      <p>After months of development and testing, I'm excited to present this production version of BubbleCheck. This software is designed to give you, the educator, thorough, immediate assessment feedback so that you can create dynamic, data-driven curriculum. A special "thank you" to everyone who beta-tested the software.  <router-link :to="'Register'">Register here</router-link> -- Taylor</p>
